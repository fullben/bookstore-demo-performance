/**
 * Facility to execute operations with striped read and write locks.
 *
 * <p>Conceptually, lock striping is the technique of dividing a lock into many stripes, increasing
 * the granularity of a single lock and allowing independent operations to lock different stripes
 * and proceed concurrently, instead of creating contention for a single lock.
 *
 * <p>Non-reentrant read operations are not allowed until all write operations of the affected
 * stripe have been finished. Additionally, a write operation can acquire the read lock, but not
 * vice-versa.
