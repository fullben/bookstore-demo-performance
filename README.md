# MicroStream BookStore Performance Demo

![BookStore Demo](./docs/images/bookstoredemo.svg?raw=true)

With this demo the superior performance of MicroStream and the Java VM compared to JPA with a connected database is visualized.
It is a Spring Boot application with a Vaadin frontend. Per default Postgres is used, but you can change the application's setup, to use any other database.

This derivation from the original implementation by the MicroStream devs includes an extension for evaluating the performance using a REST API and [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/). The documentation for this part of the project is available in a dedicated [README](README_EXTENSION.md) file.

## Setup

- First you need to setup a Postgres database. Then the connection settings must be adjusted in the [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) file accordingly.

- Start the program via its main class: [one.microstream.demo.bookstore.Application](src/main/java/one/microstream/demo/bookstore/Application.java)

- At the first start a new MicroStream database is generated with random data. Depending on the setting `bookstoredemo.initialDataAmount` more or less data is produced.

- Then the data has to be migrated to the connected JPA database
  
  - If `bookstoredemo.jpaDataMigrationStrategy` is `batch_insert` (default), the data will be automatically migrated.
 
  - If it is set to `sql_file` the generated data will be written into a SQL file, which must then be imported into the JPA database.
  It can be found in the configured data directory `bookstoredemo.dataDir`, default is [userhome]/microstream-bookstoredemo.
  Please note, that this is by far the faster way, but the generated inserts are optimized for Postgres and probably won't work with a different database.
  
Here you can see the entity relationship diagram of the generated database:

## Usage

After the application has started, open the client interface at: [http://localhost](http://localhost).
